## üíæDatabase options

This project can use either a local database or a more scalable option like MongoDB or MySQL.

### Local database

> [!NOTE]
> Not recommended.

For the local database (file system), the project uses the lowdb library, which stores data in a JSON file. There is a class called LocalDB in server/src/helpers from which you can instantiate an object that facilitates queries to the database that includes methods such as addOne, findOne, removeOne, etc., to manage the data.

### Non-local database

To use a non-local database such as MongoDB or MySQL, create a model similar to the local database model to avoid changing the controller and other parts of the application. For better integration, types are provided in server/src/types.
